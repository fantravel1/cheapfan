                        <p itemprop="text">Most NBA and NHL teams offer student rush or college night deals ($15-30). Many MLB teams have college ID specials ($8-20). MLS teams frequently have student sections ($15-25). NFL student deals are rarest but some teams offer them for select games. Check individual team websites and apps - deals are often released 24-48 hours before game time.</p>

                        <p itemprop="text">Student rush tickets are heavily discounted tickets released 2-4 hours before game time, available only with valid student ID. Prices typically range from $15-30 for NBA/NHL games. They're released through team apps or at box offices. Availability varies by game demand - weeknight games against non-marquee opponents have best availability.</p>

                        <p itemprop="text">Most student IDs don't have expiration dates printed on them. Some venues check expiration dates, most don't. We don't officially recommend using expired IDs, but the reality is that verification varies. Many teams use digital verification through apps like UNiDAYS or Student Beans that require active enrollment proof.</p>

                        <p itemprop="text">Focus on campus sports (free with student ID) and minor league teams nearby. Most college towns have minor league baseball, hockey, or soccer within 30-60 miles. Plan road trips to nearby cities during long weekends. And remember: your own campus sports - even at smaller schools - offer genuine live sports atmosphere for $0.</p>
