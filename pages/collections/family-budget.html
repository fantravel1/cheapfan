                        <p itemprop="text">Baseball (MLB) is the most family-friendly budget sport. With 81 home games per season, supply is high. Most teams offer family packs, kids eat free days, and post-game activities like running the bases. A family of 4 can attend for $100-150 including food at many parks. Minor league baseball is even cheaper at $50-80 for a family of 4.</p>

                        <p itemprop="text">Yes, family packs typically save 25-35% vs buying tickets and food separately. They usually include 4 tickets plus food vouchers (hot dogs, drinks, sometimes popcorn). Buy directly from team websites - these deals rarely appear on resale sites. Best availability for weeknight games and non-premium opponents.</p>

                    <h3 itemprop="name">Can kids go to NFL games affordably?</h3>
                    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
                        <p itemprop="text">NFL is the hardest sport for family budgets due to only 8 home games and high demand. Best options: preseason games ($30-50 per ticket), free training camps where players interact with kids, and watching one half then leaving to avoid full food costs. Consider the tailgate experience without entering - same atmosphere, lower cost.</p>

                    <h3 itemprop="name">Why should families consider minor league sports?</h3>
                    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
                        <p itemprop="text">Minor league sports offer 90% of the experience at 20% of the cost. Family of 4 typically $50-80 all-in including parking and basic food. Players sign autographs before/after games (nearly impossible at major league). Every game has promotions - fireworks, theme nights, giveaways. Atmosphere is explicitly family-oriented vs intense major league crowds.</p>
