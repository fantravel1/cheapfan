            <h2>The Tailgating Truth</h2>
            <p>At many stadiums, the tailgate IS the event. Some fans party in the parking lot for 6 hours and watch the game on a portable TV. Others never enter the stadium at all. Understanding this culture is understanding American sports fandom.</p>

            <h2>How to Tailgate for Free (Seriously)</h2>
            <p>The secret of American tailgating: hospitality is cultural. Here's how to experience tailgating without spending money on food.</p>

                    <span class="evidence-badge tier-a">Tier A</span>
                    <h3>The Walk-Through</h3>
                    <p>Walk the lots with a friendly demeanor. Wear team colors. Make eye contact. Smile. At most NFL tailgates, someone will offer you food within 30 minutes. It's considered good luck to share.</p>
                    <div class="hack-data">
                        <span class="data-label">Success rate</span>

                    <h3>Bring a Contribution</h3>
                    <p>Bring a six-pack or a bag of chips. Approach any group and say "Mind if we join? We brought beer." You're now part of the tailgate. This works 95% of the time.</p>

                    <h3>Be a Good Guest</h3>
                    <p>Help clean up. Offer to man the grill. Engage with people. The tailgate community remembers faces. Come back next game and you have standing invitation.</p>

                    <h3>Visiting Fan Sympathy</h3>
                    <p>Wearing opposing team colors? Many tailgates will feed you anyway with friendly trash talk. "You're gonna need this food to cry into later" is said while handing you a brat.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>The Unwritten Rule</h4>
                <p>At Kansas City, Buffalo, and Green Bay especially, turning down hospitality is considered rude. These communities take pride in the generosity. Accept the food. Make friends. Return the favor someday.</p>

                        <p itemprop="text">No, at most stadiums you only need a parking pass. Many fans tailgate for hours, watch the game on a TV in the lot, and never enter the stadium. This "tailgate-only" experience costs $30-60 for parking vs $150+ for tickets and provides the full communal atmosphere.</p>

                        <p itemprop="text">At many NFL tailgates, hospitality culture means walking up with a friendly attitude (and ideally a six-pack to share) will get you fed. Chiefs, Bills, and Packers fans especially take pride in feeding strangers. Wear team colors, be respectful, help clean up, and you'll often eat for the cost of a $12 contribution.</p>
