            <h2>The Light Rail Advantage</h2>
            <p>Seattle's Link Light Rail is a game-changer for sports travel. Every major venue is on or near the line.</p>

                    <h3>Mariners View Level ($15)</h3>
                    <p>T-Mobile Park's view level seats offer full-field sightlines with downtown Seattle backdrop. $15-25 on weeknights. The stadium's design means no bad seats exist.</p>

                    <p>Same stadium, same atmosphere, fraction of the price. Sounders games average $55 vs $175 for Seahawks. The supporter section (ECS) brings European-style energy.</p>

You leave Portland at 8am, arrive King Street station at 11:30, walk 5 minutes to T-Mobile Park, watch baseball with the roof open and mountains in the distance, catch the 7pm train home. Zero driving. Zero parking. Zero stress. And T-Mobile Park might be the most beautiful stadium in baseball - I've seen them all, and Seattle's view level for $22 beats any $80 lower-deck seat I've ever bought."</p>

                        <p itemprop="text">Seattle Mariners at T-Mobile Park. View level tickets start at $15 for one of baseball's most beautiful stadiums. The retractable roof means weather is never an issue. Sounders soccer is second at $25-40, offering European-style supporter atmosphere at Lumen Field for a fraction of Seahawks prices.</p>

                        <p itemprop="text">Yes - Seattle is one of the best car-free sports cities in America. Link Light Rail's Stadium station sits directly between T-Mobile Park and Lumen Field. The train runs from SeaTac airport through downtown. Climate Pledge Arena (Kraken) requires bus or 20-min walk from downtown until the new rail station opens in 2025.</p>

                    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
                        <p itemprop="text">It's overstated. T-Mobile Park has a retractable roof (never rained out). Climate Pledge Arena is fully indoor. Even Lumen Field's design provides significant rain cover for most seats. Seattle's drizzle is usually light - pack a light jacket and you're fine. The rain myth keeps some tourists away, which helps with ticket availability.</p>

                        <p itemprop="text">The 12th Man culture created legendary demand. Lumen Field's design (steep, enclosed) creates the loudest outdoor stadium in America, making every seat feel premium. Only 8 home games per year creates scarcity. Post-Super Bowl era has cooled prices slightly, but Seattle remains a top-5 NFL market. Best budget options: non-division NFC opponents, 300-level seats.</p>
