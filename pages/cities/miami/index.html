            <h2>The Messi Reality Check</h2>
            <p>Lionel Messi at Inter Miami created the biggest pricing distortion in MLS history. Here's the data:</p>

            <div class="insight-box warning">
                <h4>The Load Management Problem</h4>
                <p>Messi doesn't play every game. He rests for CCL matches, sits out midweek games, and manages his minutes at 37 years old. If you're paying $350 to see Messi, verify he's playing. Check injury reports, travel schedules, and recent appearances. A "Messi-less" Inter Miami game can cost $85 - which is still premium MLS but not life savings.</p>

                    <h3>Marlins: AC + $8 Baseball</h3>
                    <p>LoanDepot Park is air-conditioned. In Miami summer, this matters. Upper deck starts at $8. The retractable roof stadium is beautiful, empty, and cheap. Peak value.</p>
                    <div class="hack-data">
                        <span class="data-label">Avg weeknight ticket</span>

                    <span class="evidence-badge tier-a">Tier A</span>
                    <h3>September Dolphins Games</h3>
                    <p>Hard Rock Stadium in September is brutal - 90°F with humidity. Casual fans skip these games. Tickets drop 25-35% vs December. Bring water and embrace the sweat.</p>
                    <div class="hack-data">
                        <span class="data-label">Sept vs Dec avg</span>

                    <h3>Panthers Weeknight Value</h3>
                    <p>The Panthers are in Sunrise, 40 minutes from South Beach. That distance filters out tourists. Tuesday/Wednesday games see $28-40 upper deck prices for a Stanley Cup champion.</p>
                    <div class="hack-data">
                        <span class="data-label">Weeknight floor</span>

                    <h3>Inter Miami Away Games</h3>
                    <p>Want to see Messi for under $100? Catch Inter Miami on the road. When they play in Nashville, Charlotte, or Atlanta, away sections run $75-120 vs $300+ at home.</p>
                    <div class="hack-data">

                    <h3>Heat Weeknight Strategy</h3>
                    <p>Heat Culture creates consistent demand, but Tuesday/Wednesday vs non-playoff teams still sees upper deck at $35-50. Target Pistons, Wizards, Hornets matchups.</p>
                    <div class="hack-data">

                    <h3>Metrorail to Venues</h3>
                    <p>Miami Metrorail connects downtown to Kaseya Center area. $2.25 per trip beats $30+ parking and traffic nightmare. Marlins Park is walkable from Culmer station.</p>

                    <p>Most accessible venue. Metrorail nearby. Walkable from Brickell hotels. The arena itself is beautiful - views of Biscayne Bay.</p>

                        <p itemprop="text">Miami Marlins by far. Upper deck starts at $8, lower level available for $15-30. The stadium is beautiful, air-conditioned (crucial for Miami), and usually empty. Panthers hockey is second at $28-40 for weeknight games, though their 2024 Stanley Cup win will increase prices.</p>

                        <p itemprop="text">Downtown/Brickell for Heat and Marlins - walking distance to Kaseya Center, short ride to LoanDepot Park. Fort Lauderdale area if seeing Inter Miami or Panthers - those venues are 30-40 minutes from Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale hotels are 40% cheaper. Avoid South Beach unless nightlife is your priority.</p>

                        <p itemprop="text">Yes if budget matters. September games at Hard Rock Stadium can be brutal (90°F+ with humidity), which drops ticket prices 25-35% vs cooler months. Bring water, wear light clothing, and sit in shaded sections if possible. The Dolphins have improved significantly, so early-season games now have playoff implications.</p>
