                    <p>Houston is a <strong>budget-friendly sports city</strong>. Unlike coastal cities, ticket prices stay reasonable even for winning teams. The Astros won the 2022 World Series and you can still get in for $25. The challenge isn't cost - it's the sprawl. Houston is huge, and venues are spread across the city. Master the METRORail and you'll do fine.</p>

The Houston skyline lit up, 75 degrees in October, $105 spent on three pro sports tickets. My buddy in Dallas paid $180 for nosebleeds at one Cowboys game that same weekend. He asked how Houston was. I just sent him my receipt. He's planning his own trip now."</p>

                        <h4>What is the cheapest professional sports team to see in Houston?</h4>
                        <p>The Houston Dash (NWSL) offers the most affordable tickets, starting at $15-25. Houston Dynamo games are also budget-friendly at $20-35. Both play at Shell Energy Stadium which has excellent METRORail access.</p>

                        <h4>How do I get around Houston for sports events without a car?</h4>
                        <p>METRORail connects downtown venues (Toyota Center, Minute Maid Park) and Shell Energy Stadium. NRG Stadium for Texans games requires the 56 bus or rideshare. The free GreenLink downtown circulator helps between downtown venues.</p>

                        <h4>When is the best time to visit Houston for budget sports trips?</h4>
                        <p>October-November and March-April offer the best combination of tolerable weather and multiple sports seasons overlapping. Avoid June-August unless you're prepared for extreme heat and humidity.</p>

                        <h4>How much does parking cost at Houston sports venues?</h4>
                        <p>Official parking ranges from $20-50 depending on venue and event. Budget tip: Park at METRORail park-and-ride lots for $3-5 and take the train, or find street parking in EaDo for downtown venues.</p>

                        <p>A realistic Houston sports trip budget is $100-250 per person including tickets, transport, and food. The spread-out city means transport costs add up, but affordable ticket prices and cheap Tex-Mex offset this.</p>
