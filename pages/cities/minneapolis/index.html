                    <p>Minneapolis is a <strong>stealth budget sports destination</strong>. Four major pro teams, Midwest pricing, and a downtown so compact you can walk between three venues. The catch? Winter is brutal. But every venue is indoors or has climate solutions, and the legendary skyway system means you never have to face the cold. Master the light rail and layer up - Minneapolis rewards prepared fans.</p>

                        <p>"Saturday night, walking through the skyway from Target Center to grab dinner in North Loop. It's -8F outside, and I'm in a light sweater, looking down at the frozen streets from the elevated walkways. The light rail took me to St. Paul for the Wild game, dropped me back at MOA by midnight. Two pro hockey/basketball games, two cities, zero frostbite, under $275. My coworker spent $350 on a single Bears game that same weekend. Minneapolis gets it - sports should be accessible, even when nature isn't cooperating."</p>

                        <h4>What is the cheapest professional sports team to see in Minneapolis?</h4>
                        <p>The Minnesota Twins offer the most affordable entry at $12-25 for weeknight games. Minnesota Wild tickets start around $35-55, making them the priciest option. Timberwolves weeknight games can be found for $20-40.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>How do I get around Minneapolis for sports events without a car?</h4>
                        <p>Metro Transit's Blue and Green light rail lines connect downtown venues, Mall of America, and the airport. The downtown skyway system connects 80 blocks of climate-controlled walkways - perfect for winter games. A day pass costs $5.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>When is the best time to visit Minneapolis for budget sports trips?</h4>
                        <p>September-October offers ideal weather with Twins, Vikings, and Wild/Timberwolves preseason overlapping. April-May brings playoff potential across multiple sports with mild temperatures. Winter trips require cold weather planning but offer lower hotel rates.</p>

                        <h4>Is Mall of America a good base for Minneapolis sports trips?</h4>
                        <p>Yes - Mall of America area hotels run 20-40% cheaper than downtown, with direct light rail to Target Field and Target Center (30-35 minutes). Great for families combining sports with entertainment. Book weekday rates for best deals.</p>

                        <h4>What's a realistic budget for a Minneapolis sports trip?</h4>
                        <p>A realistic Minneapolis sports trip budget is $90-220 per person including tickets, transport, and food. Midwest pricing keeps costs reasonable, and the compact downtown with light rail access minimizes transport expenses.</p>
