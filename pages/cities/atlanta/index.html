                        <p itemprop="text">Yes. $2 hot dogs, $2 refillable sodas, $3 pizza slices, $5 domestic beers. This applies to both Falcons and Atlanta United games. MBS pioneered "fan-first pricing" and it works - a family of 4 can eat for $20-25 vs $80+ at most NFL stadiums. Revenue actually increased because fans buy more at fair prices.</p>

Atlanta United games at Mercedes-Benz Stadium are one of America's best live sports experiences regardless of sport. 70,000+ fans, European-style supporter culture, the Viking Clap, and MBS's $2 hot dogs.
