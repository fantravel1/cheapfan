                <h4>Real Talk: 5,280 Feet Matters</h4>
                <p>Denver sits one mile above sea level. If you're visiting from sea level, you'll feel it. Drink extra water, take it easy on the alcohol (it hits harder), and don't be surprised if you're winded walking uphill. This is also why Coors Field is famous for home runs - the thin air carries balls further.</p>

            <div class="pro-tip">
                <h4>The Beer Warning</h4>
                <p>Denver has 150+ craft breweries. You will drink at altitude. You will get drunk faster. Pace yourself or pay the price. The locals know - they'll be two drinks ahead of you and still standing.</p>

                        <p itemprop="text">Yes. At 5,280 feet, you'll notice faster intoxication (drink water between beers), potential breathlessness when walking uphill, and possibly headaches if you're sensitive. Stay hydrated and pace yourself. The thin air also makes Coors Field a home run paradise - balls carry 9% further than at sea level.</p>
