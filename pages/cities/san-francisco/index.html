The 49ers sell out every game. But here's the secret: the Bay Area sprawls across three major cities, and that geographic spread creates budget opportunities. Oakland is 40% cheaper. San Jose has NHL hockey for the price of a fancy coffee. And the Giants? Their park is so beautiful they practically give away weekday tickets to fill it.</p>

                        "Everyone told me San Francisco would destroy my budget. $400/night hotels, $200 Warriors tickets. So I did my research. Oakland Marriott for $165/night. Giants Tuesday game for $24. Sharks Friday for $38. BART everywhere. Mission burritos twice. I spent $487 total for a 3-day, 2-game Bay Area sports trip. And Oracle Park at sunset? The most beautiful stadium I've ever seen."

                        <h4>The Moment:</h4>
                        <p>"I was standing in the View Reserved section at Oracle Park, third inning. The sun was setting over the Bay. The fog was rolling in past the left field wall. McCovey Cove had kayakers waiting for splash hits. I paid $24 for this view. Twenty-four dollars. People in San Francisco pay more for avocado toast. That's when I realized: the expensive cities aren't expensive if you know the hacks. The tech bros can have their $500 lower bowl seats. I had the sunset."</p>

                        <h4>What is the cheapest pro sports team to watch in the Bay Area?</h4>
                        <p>The San Jose Sharks offer the best budget option with tickets starting at $25-40 for weeknight games. The Giants also offer affordable options with weekday games against non-contenders starting around $18-25 in the upper deck.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>How do I get to a 49ers game without paying for expensive parking?</h4>
                        <p>Take Caltrain to the Mountain View station, then catch the free VTA Light Rail shuttle to Levi's Stadium. Total cost is about $15 round trip from San Francisco. This saves you $50-70 compared to stadium parking.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>Is staying in Oakland cheaper than San Francisco?</h4>
                        <p>Yes, Oakland hotels are typically 40-50% cheaper than San Francisco. BART connects Oakland to all SF venues in 15-25 minutes for $4-6 each way. Downtown Oakland and Jack London Square offer the best budget accommodation options.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>Can I see multiple Bay Area teams in one trip?</h4>
                        <p>Absolutely. The Warriors and Giants both play in San Francisco, making same-day doubles possible during baseball season. You can also pair a Giants day game with a Sharks night game in San Jose via Caltrain.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>What are the best budget food options near Bay Area stadiums?</h4>
                        <p>Before Giants games, hit the Mission District (16th St BART) for $8-12 burritos. Before Warriors games, grab affordable eats in Chinatown ($8-15 meals). Avoid eating inside stadiums where prices are 3x higher.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>When is the best time to buy Warriors tickets?</h4>
                        <p>Check Gametime or StubHub 2-3 hours before tip-off for last-minute deals. Tuesday/Wednesday games against rebuilding teams (Pistons, Jazz, Blazers) offer the best prices, often 40-50% cheaper than weekend or rival games.</p>
