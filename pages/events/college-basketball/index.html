First-round sessions (Thursday/Friday) at smaller host cities like Spokane or Albany run $35-55 for 4-game sessions. Thursday afternoon sessions are consistently cheaper than evening due to work schedules.</p>

                        <p itemprop="text">The NCAA runs an annual ticket lottery for Final Four at face value ($175-350 vs $800-3000 secondary market). Applications typically open in fall for the following April's Final Four. Apply every year - odds aren't great but it's the only way to face value.

                        <p itemprop="text">Absolutely - arguably the best value in the tournament. One ticket gets you 4 complete games in the first round (8+ hours of basketball). At $35-75 per session, you're paying $9-19 per game. You'll witness upsets, see future NBA players, and experience tournament atmosphere without Final Four pricing.</p>

                        <p itemprop="text">For regional sites (Sweet 16/Elite 8), yes. Face value pre-bracket tickets are often 50-70% cheaper than post-bracket secondary market prices. You won't know which teams you'll see, but you're guaranteed 4 high-stakes tournament games. For first-round sites, prices don't spike as dramatically, so waiting is lower risk.</p>
