            <h2>Sharing MetLife with the Jets</h2>
            <p>MetLife is the NFL's only stadium shared by two teams. This creates unique dynamics for budget fans.</p>

                <h4>The Shared Stadium Effect</h4>
                <ul class="section-list">
                    <li><strong>More inventory = lower prices:</strong> 17+ NFL home dates means more chances to attend</li>
                    <li><strong>Color scheme flips:</strong> Stadium transforms from blue (Giants) to green (Jets) between games</li>
                    <li><strong>Neutral turf:</strong> Neither team has true home-field advantage statistically</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-schedule opportunity:</strong> If Giants are away, maybe catch Jets at home instead</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Best Budget Sections</h4>
                <ul class="section-list">
                    <li><strong>Upper 300s (corners):</strong> $75-120 - Best value, full field view</li>
                    <li><strong>Upper 300s (endzone):</strong> $85-130 - Watch plays develop toward you</li>
                    <li><strong>Mezzanine 200s:</strong> $145-200 - Covered, better sightlines</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>The Jets Arbitrage</h4>
                <p>Giants tickets average 15% more than Jets tickets for comparable opponents. Same stadium, same amenities, same NFL football. If you're opponent-agnostic, check Jets prices for your target weekend - you might save $25-40 for an equivalent experience.</p>

Buy 24-48 hours before game time when season ticket holders panic-sell. We've verified tickets as low as $75 using this strategy. Preseason games average $35-50 and offer the same MetLife experience.</p>

The 351 bus runs frequently on game days, and express buses are timed to kickoff. Alternatively, take NJ Transit rail from Penn Station to Secaucus Junction, then the shuttle bus to the stadium for about $11 round trip.</p>

                        <p itemprop="text">If you're strictly budget-focused, yes. Eagles and Cowboys games at MetLife average $365-385, nearly 3x the cost of AFC opponents. These rivalry games also don't see last-minute price drops - they often increase as kickoff approaches due to traveling fan demand. The atmosphere is electric but the economics are brutal.</p>

                        <p itemprop="text">Absolutely. MetLife was designed with excellent sightlines throughout. Upper 300 level sections offer full-field views and are actually preferred by many fans for watching plays develop. Corner sections (301-304, 340-345) are the best value at $75-120. You'll save $100+ compared to lower level and still have a great experience.</p>

                        <p itemprop="text">MetLife allows one clear bag (12"x6"x12" or smaller) plus a small clutch purse. You can bring factory-sealed plastic bottles (up to 20oz) and sealed food items in your clear bag. This is huge for budget fans - bring snacks, empty your water bottle at security, and refill inside at fountains to save $20+ on concessions.</p>

                        <p itemprop="text">Yes, and it's one of the best ways to save money. Parking lots open 5 hours before kickoff. You can bring coolers, grills, and alcohol to consume in the lots (not inside the stadium). Budget $15-25 per person for a full tailgate spread versus $40+ for food and drinks inside. Private lots on Paterson Plank Road charge $25-35 for parking.</p>
