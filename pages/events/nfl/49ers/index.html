                <p>For Rams, Cowboys, Seahawks, and Packers games, this timing doesn't work. Those games often increase in price closer to kickoff as supply depletes. Buy premium opponents 2-3 weeks out. Only try game-day timing for Cardinals, AFC rotation, and rebuilding NFC teams.</p>

                    <li><strong>Caltrain Strategy:</strong> Take the express from SF 4th & King to Santa Clara station, then free stadium shuttle. Last train back is 11:30 PM - don't miss it.</li>
                    <li><strong>VTA Light Rail:</strong> Green Line stops right at the stadium. $2.50 from Santa Clara Caltrain station.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rideshare Hack:</strong> Walk to Great America or the nearby hotels post-game. Surge pricing at stadium gates is 3x higher than 1/4 mile away.</li>
                    <li><strong>Carpool Savings:</strong> HOV parking at Levi's is $40 vs $60 regular. Need 3+ people.</li>

                    <li><strong>Upper 400s (Sections 401-420):</strong> $85-140 - East side gets shade in late afternoon games</li>

                    <li><strong>South End Zone (Section 403-407):</strong> $95-130 - Behind the Faithful, great atmosphere</li>

                <h4>Sun Advisory</h4>
                <p>Levi's Stadium gets HOT. The west side bakes in afternoon sun (September games hit 90F+). East side upper deck (sections 401-420) gets shade by the 4th quarter. Bring sunscreen for 1 PM kicks - there's almost no shade in the lower bowl.</p>

                        <p itemprop="text">You can bring one sealed plastic water bottle (20 oz or less) per person. No outside food is permitted. Your best budget strategy is to eat before the game (Great Mall is 10 minutes away) or tailgate in the parking lots. Inside the stadium, Ike's sandwiches are the best value - one sandwich can feed two.</p>

                    <h3 itemprop="name">Is parking at Levi's Stadium worth it?</h3>
                    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
                        <p itemprop="text">Stadium parking is $60 ($40 for HOV 3+). Great America parking lot is $40 with a longer walk but faster exit. If coming from SF, public transit at $11-15 round trip is the clear budget winner. Post-game traffic can add 45+ minutes to your drive - factor that into your decision.</p>
