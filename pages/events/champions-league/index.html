                                Realistic ranges: <strong>Group stage: $50-150</strong> depending on club and seat location.
                                <strong>Knockout rounds: $120-500+</strong> with prices escalating each round. Away sections are
                                typically 40-60% cheaper than home sections at elite clubs.

                                Yes! The key is club membership (most clubs allow international members) and targeting accessible
                                clubs. Celtic, Benfica, PSV, Porto, and Salzburg all welcome international fans and have reasonable
                                availability. The away section strategy also works for any nationality.

                                <strong>We don't recommend it.</strong> Many clubs actively cancel tickets purchased through
                                unauthorized resale. Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern, and English clubs are particularly strict.
                                Fans have been turned away at gates with "valid" resale tickets. Stick to official channels.

                                Group stage: Within 1-2 weeks of the draw (late August). Knockout rounds: Within days of each

                                (e.g., 10am local time) and sell out within hours for popular clubs.

                                Honestly? Barely. Finals use a lottery system through UEFA with face value tickets ($70-600
                                depending on category), but odds are roughly 1-5%. Resale prices exceed $1,000-3,000. If you
                                win the lottery, it's incredible value. Otherwise, watch in a fan zone near the stadium.
