## 🧠 Core Philosophy

CheapFan is **not a deals blog**.  
It is a **structured fan-access knowledge graph** expressed as static pages.

LLMs are used to:
- surface creative strategies
- adapt hacks by geography
- translate & localize
- cluster patterns & rankings

Humans are required to:
- verify safety & legality
- validate pricing logic
- approve confidence tiers
- remove outdated methods

---

## 🗂️ Content Architecture (LLM-Native)

CheapFan is built around **repeatable, real-world entities**.

### Core Entities
- Event
- Team / Artist / Franchise
- Venue
- City
- Travel Route
- Ticket Strategy
- Lodging Strategy
- Evidence
- Collection

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
- has a canonical URL
- cross-links logically
- can be generated programmatically
